# 3D Printable Atari SIO Plug

Here's yet another 3D printable version of the Atari SIO plug.

There are two files:

* PlugFront.STL - This is the main connector housing. Best printing results when you point the socket end down on the bed. Yes, there is a slight overhang, but doing it this way ensures that internal contact retention features get printed correctly.
* ShellHalf.STL - This is the connector overshell. Print two.

The compatible pins are the Molex 08-50-0106 which you can find at
